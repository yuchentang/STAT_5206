## What happens when we fit the wrong model to the data?
It is common in Statistics to wonder the impact of fitting the wrong model to the data.

For this exercise, we will focus on fitting **unimodal distributions** to multi-modal data.

### Problem 0, simulating multi-modal data via a Gaussian Mixture

You can imagine a distribution with $k$ modes comes from overlaying $k$ different Gaussian distributions on top of each other. To simulate something like that, we could define:

$$X \sim MultiNomial(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_k)$$
$$Y|X \sim Normal(\mu_{X}, \sigma^2_{X})$$

where $p_i = P(X=i)$, then we say $Y$ is a mixture Gaussian with $k$ mixtures. There will be $3k$ number of parameters overall, $p_1, \dots, p_k$, $\mu_1, \dots, \mu_k$, and $\sigma^2_1, \dots, \sigma^2_k$.

The 2 stage expression above suggests how we could simulate this using standard distributions like the multinomial and Gaussian.

- Before you start coding, write down in words, how you would translate the mathematical expression into a 2 stage sampling process using the multinomial and Gaussian distribution. Make sure you reference the parameters in your description.

```{r}


```

### Problem 1:

We will eventually write a function called `rmixgauss(n, mix_probs, mus, sds)` that draws $n$ different samples from a Mixture Gaussian.

However, we will start off with a simpler version called `binary_rmixgauss(n, mix_probs, mus, sds)` and slowly generalize this. As the name suggests, we will be assuming there are only 2 mixtures, i.e. $k = 2$.

Your function should use 2 built-in functions in R, `sample()` and `rnorm()` to help produce the final function. In particular, `sample()` has an argument `prob` that can adjust the sampling probabilities.

- What data type should each input be and their respective size?
- Write `binary_rmixgauss()` in 3 different ways:
  - Write a function called `bi_rmixgauss_single(mix_probs, mus, sds)` then use a for-loop to generate `n` samples.
  - Use `ifelse()` where the condition depends on the length `n` dice roll vector.
  - Use `for() {...}` and `if(){...}else{...}` to write your function.
- Comment and compare on the 3 functions above, e.g. which is easiest to read?

```{r}
bi_rmixgauss_single <- function(mix_probs, mus, sds) {
        x <- sample(c(1, 2), 1, prob=mix_probs)
        return(rnorm(1, mus[x], sds[x]))
    }

binary_rmixgauss1 <- function(n, mix_probs, mus, sds) {    
    values <- vector('numeric', n)
    for(i in seq_len(n)){
        values[i] <- bi_rmixgauss_single(mix_probs, mus, sds)
    }
    return(values)
}

```

### Problem 2: Testing your functions

Please run the following test cases against your favorite version from Problem 1.
  - Test cases:
    - `binary_rmixgauss(100, c(0.5, 0.5), c(0, 10), c(3, 3))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(-1, c(0.5, 0.5), c(0, 10), c(3, 3))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(0, c(0.5, 0.5), c(0, 10), c(3, 3))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(10, c(1, 0), c(0, 10), c(3, 3))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(10, c(0.33, 0.67, 0.5), c(0, 10), c(3, 3))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(10, c(0.33, 0.33), c(0, 10, -10), c(3, 3))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(10, c(0.33, 0.33), c(0, 10), c(3, 3, -1))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(10, c(0.33, 0.67), c(0, 10), c(3, -1))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(c(10, 5), c(0.33, 0.33), c(0, 10), c(3, 1))`
    - `binary_rmixgauss(10, c(0.5, 0.5), c(0, 10), c(1, 1))`
  - Make sure each test case is performing as you expected, discuss with your group to make sure you're on the same page.
    - Notice how R handles all the different cases!
  - Try running all 3 versions of your function on the last test case but increase `n=100`, and look at the data using `hist(data)`
    hint:
    ```
    funs <- c(median, mean, sum)
    data <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 100)
    for(my_fun in funs){
        print(my_fun(data))
    }
    ```
  - What is the data type for `funs` in the example above?
  
  
```{r}

```

### Problem 3: Input validation

- In problem 1, we stated some expectations for the input lengths and data types. It's often good to check the inputs before executing any code. Please write a function called `check_rmixgauss_input()` that checks for the conditions you stated in Problem 1 and use `stop()` to give the user meaningful error messages.
- Please add this sanity check function into your favorite version of the `binary_rmixgauss()` function and run through **some of the** test cases one more time.

```{r}
```


### Problm 4: Simulating data and fitting the wrong model!
A method to fit a model to data is to **search** for the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood of observing the sample, i.e.
  $$\theta_{MLE} = \arg\max_{\theta} \log p_{\theta}(data)$$
  So if we assume the data follows a Normal distribution and the samples are independent from one another, we can rewrite this as:
  $$\theta_{MLE} = \arg\max \log \prod_i \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{y_i - \mu}{\sigma})^2\right)$$

- Please generate an **obviously bimodal** distribution using 1000 samples using your function above. Hint: you can check with `hist(rnorm(100))` to get the histogram of your samples.
- Since we have not covered optimization yet and to further illustrate the use of for-loops, we use a for-loop to sweep across a range of values to search for a reasonably parameters that can describe the data. Use `seq()` to create "reasonable" candidate values for both $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ (you should have 2 vectors at the end of this, they do not need to be the same length).
- Pick arbitrary values among your candidate values from above, calculate the log-density of your sample using R's built-in function `dnorm(y, mu, sd, log=TRUE)`.
- Pick another set of arbitrary values among your candidate values from above, calculate the log-density, which set of parameter values is better? Why?
- Now calculate the log-density of your sample using **each possible combinations** of your candidate $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ and report the pair that has the highest value. While comparing different combination of your candidate values, **if** the new pair of parameter values produce a larger log-density, **then** you should update your $\hat{\mu}$, and $\hat{\sigma}^2$. Hint:
  ```
  par1 <- 1:2
  par2 <- 4:7
  candidates <- expand.grid(par1, par2)
  dim(candidates)
  head(candidates)
  largest <- 0
  for(i in seq_len(dim(candidates)[1])){
      challenger <- candidates[i, 1] + candidates[i, 2]
      if(largest < challenger){
          
      }
  }
  ```  
- Please plot your sample against your fitted Normal distribution by modifying the code below:
  ```
  data <- rnorm(1000)
  hist(data, freq = FALSE)
  best_normal <- function(x) return(dnorm(x, 0, 1))
  curve(best_normal, min(data), max(data), col="blue", add=TRUE)
  ```
- Please comment on whether the best model worked as you expected.

```{r}

```


### Problem 5: Generalizing functions

Here we'll relax the assumption that $k=2$.
- What happens when we pass a vector for the mean and sd, e.g. `rnorm(2, c(0, 10), c(0.1, 3))`?
  - What happens if you change `n=6`?
- Recall that we can subset the same index multiple times, e.g. `c(-1, -2, -3)[c(1, 1, 3)]`, use this fact and the above result to write rmixguass(). This function should avoid any for-loop or if/else logic.
  - Don't forget to update the input validation function as well!
- Check your function works by running
  ```
  
  dat <- rmixgauss(1000,
                   c(0.3, 0.1, 0.6),
                   c(-10, 0, 10),
                   c(1, 1, 3))
  hist(dat)
  ```
